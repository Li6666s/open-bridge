# overlay-autosync.sh — unattended sync of every subscribed org overlay.
#
# The companion to upstream-autoupdate.sh. That one keeps CORE current; this one
# keeps the ORG layer current. Without it, staying current is a thing somebody
# has to remember, and the failure is silent: an overlay drifts for weeks while
# every session keeps using the copy it happens to hold. Measured on the
# instance this comes from: 71 days stale, 124 overlay commits behind, 6 of 26
# org skills present — and the skill somebody was looking for was in the other 20.
#
# WHY THIS CAN RUN UNATTENDED AT ALL. The engine's non-interactive sync splits
# the work exactly where the trust boundary sits:
#   · config, contexts, projects, mandants, accounts   → applied
#   · updates to behavioural files ALREADY accepted    → applied (the [y] gate
#     is first-materialize only: `first_time = dest not in prev_files`)
#   · behavioural files arriving for the FIRST time    → SKIPPED, listed, never
#     silently installed
# So the publisher stays responsible for what it ships, the consumer keeps one
# decision per genuinely new tool, and nothing in between needs a human.
# A new skill is therefore REPORTED, not applied — that is the point, not a gap.
#
# THE DECISION LIVES IN THE ENGINE: `overlay.py sync --unattended` plans each
# overlay and applies it only when the plan needs nobody. This script schedules
# it, writes the report and sends the notification.
#   · a conflict with a local edit     → the overlay is HELD, nothing written
#   · a planned deletion               → HELD, nothing written
#   · a new behavioural file           → applied without it, listed as pending
#   · inside pull_interval_days        → not-due, nothing fetched
# Why a conflict holds the whole overlay: plain `sync --yes` keeps the local side
# and advances the lock pin, and from the next run on the file reads as an
# ordinary local edit. The upstream change was lost and nothing said so any
# more. Why a deletion holds it: an unattended run applies and updates, it never
# deletes. The engine's own prune guard lets up to LARGE_PRUNE_THRESHOLD (5)
# clean orphans go under --yes; measured when this script was first written,
# exactly 5 were planned, and one of them
# (skills/meeting-transcription/scripts/anchor_transcript.py) was a TRACKED file
# CORE ships, an orphan only because the overlay had stopped shipping that skill.
# A deletion is a human's call, so it escalates to one.
#
# Notifies when the outcome CHANGES, not every morning: a held overlay stays
# held until somebody acts, and the same message daily is noise. `/overlay
# status` shows the last run at any time.
#
# Env (optional): SIGNAL_ACCOUNT + SIGNAL_RECIPIENT (both set → Signal push).
